# Github Blog

Third challenge of the React course in Rocketseat platform. 

The goal was to develop a blog with Github's Issue section and also display the profile information.

The user can search Issue topics on a search bar and click on the issue's card to check more details.


## Stacks

**Front-end:** React (Vite), TailwindCSS, Github API, React Router

## Functionality

- Desktop view
- Github's Issue section search on profile displayed
- Github's user information


## Running local

Clone project

```bash
  git clone https://project-link
```

Go into project's directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Initialize local server

```bash
  npm run dev
```


## Take Aways

- Improved knowledge of tailwind lib
- React hooks knowledge improvement (useState, useEffect)
- API consumption and data handling
- Typescript's Type and Interface functionalities
- Use of a standard layout to display common's traits of pages
- Use of React Router to organize routes

## Future Improvements
